# Funnel Logic: User Onboarding Journey

This funnel tracks the onboarding flow for users who first triggered the "Welcome" event in June 2023. The goal is to understand how users move through key product stages and identify drop-off points.

## Funnel Steps

1. **Welcome**  
   Initial entry point — user opens the app for the first time.

2. **User Sign Up**  
   Account creation or registration step.

3. **Main Landing Screen**  
   First screen after login — core navigation hub.

4. **Search Song or Video**  
   User initiates a search — signals intent to engage.

5. **Play Song or Video**  
   Final action — confirms successful onboarding and product value.
