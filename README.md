# Amplitude Case: User Onboarding Funnel Analysis

This project demonstrates how to analyze user onboarding behavior using Amplitude's demo data (Media Streaming - Analytics).

## Objective

- Build a cohort: users from the US, on iOS and Android, who first triggered the "Welcome" event in June 2023
- Construct an onboarding funnel: Welcome → Sign Up → Main Screen → Search → Play
- Analyze conversion, time to complete, activity levels, and retention

## Visualizations

- Funnel breakdown by platform
- Daily conversion and time to complete
- Daily active users: Play vs any active event
- Average events per user per day
- Retention chart from Welcome to active events

## Bonus

- Journey Map: user path from Welcome to Play Song or Video

## Tools

- Amplitude Demo Dashboard
- Cohorts, Funnels, Retention, Segmentation
